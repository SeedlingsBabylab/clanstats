Eb pulled all csvs from 01-43 into the csv folder. Notable issues:
01_06, 02_06, 03_06 there are multiples, went with DL_AS one because it's in right format
01_07 & 02_07 used consensus file
27_06 and 29_07 21_06 21_07 22_06, 22_07, 23_06, 26_06 had comments columns; deleted and replaced file
 
07_06, 23_06, 26_06, 28_07 empty column

a few ad incorrect header columns: 40, 27_06 no underscore; 36_07 AF2 header
